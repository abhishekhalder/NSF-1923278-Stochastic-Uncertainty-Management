The Uncertainty sources may include stochastic forcing and parametric uncertainties at some generators, random variabilities at some loads, and parametric uncertainties along some transmission lines. For depiction purposes, we indicated the parametric uncertainties as PDFs, and stochastic forcing as intermittent signals.}}

The location of the points $\{\bm{x}_{k}^{i}\}_{i=1}^{N}$ can be updated by Euler-Maruyama scheme applied to (\ref{ItoSDEvectorlevel}); the corresponding probability weights $\{\varrho_{k}^{i}\}_{i=1}^{N}$ can be updated via discrete version of the proximal recursion (\ref{ProxRecursionInfiniteDim}).}}

Halder}
is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Applied Mathematics,
and is an affiliated faculty in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at
University of California, Santa Cruz. Before that he held postdoctoral
positions in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at
University of California, Irvine, and in the Department of Electrical
and Computer Engineering at Texas A\&M University. He obtained his
Bachelors and Masters from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur in
2008, and Ph.D. from Texas A\&M University in 2014, all in Aerospace
Engineering. His research interests are in stochastic systems, control
and optimization with application focus on large scale cyber-physical
systems.
